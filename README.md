# React ServiceNow KB Articles App

A simple React app deployed to ServiceNow that displays 40 Knowledge articles (10 per page).

The app utilizes the ServiceNow REST Table API to display the Number, Topic, Short Description, and Date Published for articles from the kb_knowledge table.

To build this app, I used a simple and lightweight boilerplate to build React applications for ServiceNow created by Andrew Pishchulin.

Based on [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
